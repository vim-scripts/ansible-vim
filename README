This is a vim syntax plugin for Ansible 2.0, it supports YAML playbooks, Jinja2 templates, and dotini-based 'hosts' files.

YAML playbooks are detected if:
- they are in the group_vars or host_vars folder
- they are in the tasks or roles folder and have either a .yml or .yaml suffix
- they are named playbook.y(a)ml or site.y(a)ml
Jinja2 templates are detected if they have a .j2 suffix
Files named hosts will be treated as Ansible hosts files

This plugin should be quite reliable, as it sources the original formats and simply modifies the highlights as appropriate. This also enables a focus on simplicity and configurability instead of patching bad syntax detection.
